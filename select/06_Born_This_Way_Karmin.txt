My mama told me, when I was young
We are all born superstars.
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir.

"There's nothing wrong lovin' who you are,"
She said, "'cause he made you perfect babe."
"So hold your head up, girl and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say."

I'm beautiful in my way,
'Cause god makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love youself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born -
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen

Give yourself prudence and love your friends.
Subway kid, rejoice your truth.
In the religion of the insecure,
I must be myself, respect my youth.

A different lover is not a sin,
Belive capital H-I-M (hey hey hey).
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah

I'm beautiful in my way,
'Cause god makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love youself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
No other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
No other way
Baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Wheter you're broke a evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're lebanese, you're orient

Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, builed or teased
Rejoice and love youself today
'Cause baby you were born this way

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause god makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love youself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
No other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
No other way
Baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
