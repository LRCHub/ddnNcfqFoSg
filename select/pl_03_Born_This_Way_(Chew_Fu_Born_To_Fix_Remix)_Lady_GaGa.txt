Ooh,there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooh,there ain't no other way
Baby I was born-
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way x2
〈♪〉
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
〈♪〉
She rolled my hair and
put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
〈♪〉
"There's nothing wrong with
loving who you are" She said,
"Cause he made youperfect,babe."
〈♪〉
"So hold your head up girl and
you'll go far Listen to me
when I say."
〈♪〉
I'm beautiful in my way
Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're
set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
(born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born-
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
〈♪〉
Give yourself prudence and love
your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
〈♪〉
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect
my youth
〈♪〉
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey x3
I love my life, I love this
record and Mi amore vole fe yah
〈♪〉
I'm beautiful in my way
Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're
set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
(born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
(Don't be...)
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or
evergreen You're black,
white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied
or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
Cause baby
you were born this way...
〈♪〉
you were born this way
I'm beautiful in my way
Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and
you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
〈♪〉
you were born this way
